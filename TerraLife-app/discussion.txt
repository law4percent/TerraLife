This React Native code represents a `HomeScreen` component that is part of a garden management app, where users can monitor and control irrigation systems. The component interacts with Firebase to fetch and update user-specific data such as irrigation systems, soil moisture levels, sprinkler status, and battery levels.

### Key Features:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Uses `AuthContext` to get the authenticated user's data (`user`) and `signOut` method to log out.

2. **State Management:**
   - Manages various state variables such as `loading`, `sprinklerStatus`, `newSystemName`, `systemKeys`, and others for handling UI states, system management, and data fetching.

3. **Fetching User Data:**
   - A custom hook (`useUserData`) is used to fetch the user's data from Firebase, including information about multiple irrigation systems. The data is displayed in the UI once it's loaded.

4. **UI Components:**
   - Displays a header with user info and a logo.
   - Lists different irrigation systems (`system0` being the main system and other systems as variants), showing details such as system name, battery level, soil moisture, and last update time.
   - Provides functionality for managing systems, including:
     - Renaming a system via a modal.
     - Enabling/disabling systems.
     - Toggling the sprinkler status (`ON`/`OFF`).
     - Deleting a system (with a confirmation modal).
     - Adding a new system, with a limit of 15 systems.
     
5. **Sprinkler Control:**
   - Allows toggling the sprinkler system for `system0` (main irrigation controller), updating its status in Firebase.

6. **System Management:**
   - Includes options for enabling/disabling systems and renaming or deleting systems.
   - Ensures that `system0` cannot be deleted.

7. **Modal Dialogs:**
   - **Rename System Modal:** Allows renaming a system.
   - **Delete System Modal:** Confirms the deletion of a system (excluding `system0`).

8. **Other Utilities:**
   - Includes helper functions like `formatDate` for formatting timestamps and `getBatteryIcon`/`getMoistureStatus` to display the status of battery levels and soil moisture levels with icons.

### Key Considerations:
- **Loading and Error Handling:** Displays loading indicators and handles errors if fetching data fails.
- **Limit on Systems:** The app only allows up to 15 systems, which is checked before adding a new one.
- **Responsive UI:** The UI adapts based on system data, such as changing the sprinkler button’s background color based on the sprinkler’s status.

The code structure is clean, with clear separation between state management, UI rendering, and system operations, making it extensible for future features or improvements.
